1. What is Sablotron?
========================================

Sablotron is an XML processor fully implemented in C++. It uses Expat by
James Clark as an XML parser. Sablotron implements XSLT 1.0, XPath 1.0 
and DOM Level2.

Original creator of Sablotron is Ginger Alliance (www.gingerall.com).

So far Sablotron is tested on Linux (RedHat 5.2, 6.0, 6.1, 6.2, and 7.0), 
Windows (NT 4.0, 95, 98, 2000), Solaris (2.5.1, 2.6, 7), HP-UX (11.00), 
FreeBSD (3.4, 4.1), OpenBSD (2.8 beta) and OpenServer (5.0.x). We hope, 
that it should work on most other Unix systems as well.
