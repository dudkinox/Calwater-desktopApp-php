            list</i>, which means that you are required to confirm your subscription 
            request before it can become active: this prevents people from subscribing 
            you to the list without your permission, or masquerading as other 
            people.</font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2">An e-mail message has been sent to

            contains a link you can click to complete the confirmation process, 
            as well as instructions to allow you to complete the process by 
            e-mail if you prefer. You have 48 hours to confirm your subscription: 
            if you have not confirmed your subscription within that time, the 
            request will expire and you will have to place your subscription 
            request again.</font></p>
