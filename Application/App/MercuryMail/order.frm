           Ordering Pegasus Mail Manuals for Multiple Users

In order to conserve space in the Pegasus Mail distribution archive, this
file has been superseded by a section in the Pegasus Mail online guide,
WGUIDE.HLP, which should have been installed when you installed Pegasus
Mail itself.

Please open the Online Guide and consult the section "Ordering Pegasus Mail
Manuals" on the first screen for ordering details and an order form.
