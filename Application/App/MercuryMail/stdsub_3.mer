;
;  This file is used as the default template by Mercury when constructing
;  Subscription "Welcome" messages for moderated mailing lists with no
;  digest option.
;
;  You can instruct Mercury/32 to use this file as a template by entering
;  the word "standard" in the "Welcome file" field of the mailing list
;  definition. Mercury will automatically determine the proper version of
;  this template to use for the subscription.
;
;  You can edit this template using any text editor. Lines beginning with a
;  ';', like this one, are comments and are ignored: all other lines are
;  written into the message. You can place special markers in the body of the
;  template, which Mercury will replace with information about the list: these
;  markers consist of the two special characters ~p followed by a single digit
;  identifying the piece of information you want substituted. The following
;  substitutions are currently possible in this template file:
;
;     ~p0     The list's basic name (i.e, what appears to the left of the '@')
;     ~p1     This system's hostname
;     ~p2     The full title for the mailing list
;     ~p3     The address of the mailing list's primary moderator
;     ~p4     The subscriber's address
;     ~p5     The subscriber's "personal name"
;     ~p6     The formal mailing address for the list
;     ~p7     The user's password (v4.53 and later only)
;
Welcome to the ~p2 mailing list!

You have been successfully subscribed to this list and will begin
receiving mail from it immediately. This welcome message contains some
general information on your subscription and how to manage it.

This mailing list is a "moderated" mailing list: that means that only
certain people, known as "moderators" can post messages to the list's
membership. The primary moderator for this list is:
   ~p3

Please contact a list moderator to arrange for mail to be posted to the
list.

  to maiser@~p1, placing the following two lines in the
  body of the message:

  Naturally, you should change the "x" to the proper number of days. The
  list server will automatically re-enable your subscription at the end of
  the period.

  mail message to maiser@~p1, placing the following two
