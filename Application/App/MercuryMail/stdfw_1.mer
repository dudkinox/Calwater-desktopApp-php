;  Mercury/32 template file.
;  Mercury Mail Transport System, Copyright 1993-2000, David Harris.
;
;  This file is used as the default template by Mercury when constructing
;  Subscription "Farewell" messages for mailing lists that allow public
;  subscription.
;
;  You can instruct Mercury/32 to use this file as a template by entering
;  the word "standard" in the "Farewell file" field of the mailing list
;  definition. Mercury will automatically determine the proper version of
;  this template to use for the subscription.
;
;  You can edit this template using any text editor. Lines beginning with a
;  ';', like this one, are comments and are ignored: all other lines are
;  written into the message. You can place special markers in the body of the
;  template, which Mercury will replace with information about the list: these
;  markers consist of the two special characters ~p followed by a single digit
;  identifying the piece of information you want substituted. The following
;  substitutions are currently possible in this template file:
;
;     ~p0     The list's basic name (i.e, what appears to the left of the '@')
;     ~p1     This system's hostname
;     ~p2     The full title for the mailing list
;     ~p3     The address of the mailing list's primary moderator
;     ~p4     The subscriber's address
;     ~p5     The subscriber's "personal name"
;     ~p6     The formal mailing address for the list
;
Farewell from the ~p2 mailing list.

Your subscription to this list has been closed down, either in response
to an explicit request from your e-mail address, or to a command from the
list's moderator.

If you wish to re-subscribe to this list in future, please send a mail
message to maiser@~p1, containing the following two lines:

   SUBSCRIBE ~p0 ~p5
   EXIT

Best regards,
The List Management.
