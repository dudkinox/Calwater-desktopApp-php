This general-purpose definition is designed to catch a
wide range of spam, with particular emphasis on:

  * Sexual content and penile enlargement ads
  * Pharmacy and bogus health cures
  * General unwanted commercial "services"
  * Spam tools
  * 419 scams (the "Nigerian funds transfer" scam)

This ruleset aggressively filters messages containing
Lazy HTML (HTML with references to remote graphics): if
you receive a lot of legitimate mail containing Lazy
HTML, you will either need to whitelist the sources of
that mail, or else remove the test.

This rulest also regards any message containing more
than 25% non-ASCII characters as spam, so if you receive
a lot of legitimate mail of this type you will need to
take steps to deal with that.

We recommend that you do not directly modify this rule
set, because subsequent versions of Mercury will usually
attempt to update it. Instead, create a copy of this set
and work on the copy, disabling this one.

This rule set is a standard part of the Mercury/32
distribution and is updated from time to time: you can
find updated rule sets on our web site, at -
