Pegasus Mail for Windows v3.0, configurable toolbar.
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Pegasus Mail System,
Copyright (c) 1990-98, David Harris, All Rights Reserved.


Under Pegasus Mail v3.0 and later, the button panel (toolbar) is
configurable via simple scripts. The use of scripts is not normally
intended to be exposed to end-users, and it is anticipated that a
GUI-based editor will be made available at some future time. In the
meantime, however, those willing to do a small amount of work with an
editor can customize the toolbar to suit their needs.

Pegasus Mail maintains internal definitions for the toolbar in its
resource file, WINPMAIL.DAT: these definitions are usually loaded and
parsed when the toolbar is created. The user can, however, create a text
file called TOOLBAR.PM in his home mailbox, containing the same scripting
commands. If TOOLBAR.PM is found, it is loaded in preference to the
internal resource script.

The format of the resource script in TOOLBAR.PM is simple: each line
defines a single toolbar element - a button, a separator, or a combobox.
Other elements may be added in future. Lines beginning with semicolon
characters are regarded as comments and ignored.

Command lines have the following general form:

   <type> [other parameters]

"type" is an integer that determines the type of the toolbar item. The
following values are defined:

   0    A standard 22x20 pixel bitmapped button
   1    An 8-pixel separator gap
   2    A combobox control

Each type of control has its own parameter list as follows:

Bitmapped buttons:

   ,<control_id>,<flags>,<bitmap_id>,<"tooltip">
   "control_id"    the internal activation code for this button
                   (see the list below for valid values)
   "flags"         an integer, currently unused but must be 0
   "bitmap_id"     the integer code for the internal bitmap for the
                   button (see the list below)
   "tooltip"       the tooltip text the button should display when the
                   mouse lingers over it for too long. This string
                   must appear in quotes.

Separators: No parameters


Combobox controls:

   ,<control_id>,<flags>
   "control_id"    the internal activation code for this button
                   (see the list below for valid values)
   "flags"         an integer, currently unused but must be 0


Note that for combobox and button controls, there must be a comma between
the "type" parameter and the control ID.


Control IDs:

Control IDs are internal tags used to tie a button to a given internal
function. The following control IDs are recognized:

Buttons:

801      Start a new mail message
802      Open or re-scan the new mail folder
803      Work with mail folders
804      Work with address books
805      Work with distribution lists
806      Get a list of local users on the system
807      Edit filters applied when the new mail folder is opened
808      Open noticeboards

820      Cut
821      Copy
822      Paste

823      Print the current window
824      Set a font for the current window
825      Save to disk
826      Read from disk

827      Get mail via the built-in POP3 transport
828      Send mail via the built-in SMTP transport
829      Get mail then send mail
835      Perform a selective download via the built-in POP3 transport

836      Start a new circulation message.
838      Switch to the folder manager window and add a mailbox

Comboboxes:

840      List of currently-defined identities on the system

You can create a button that triggers any standard menu item in the
Pegasus Mail menu hierarchy by adding 10000 to the menu item's code (see
Appendix A, below) then using that value as the button's control ID.



Bitmap IDs:

A number of bitmaps are built-in to Pegasus Mail and can be accessed in
buttons via special bitmap IDs. The following IDs are available: note
that the text describing each button is simple description - the control
ID is what decides what function is actually associated with a button.

1801      Start a new mail message
1802      Open or re-scan the new mail folder
1803      Work with mail folders
1804      Work with address books
1805      Work with distribution lists
1806      Get a list of local users on the system
1807      Edit filters applied when the new mail folder is opened
1808      Open noticeboards

1820      Cut
1821      Copy
