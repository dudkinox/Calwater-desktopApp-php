##   Sample source for a suitable RQUOTES.PMS for use in
##   Pegasus Mail v3.0/WinPmail variable signatures.
##
##   Compile this source using ResCom.exe, by issuing the
##   command "ResCom RQUOTES.R", then copy the resulting
##   RQUOTES.RSC file into your home mailbox as RQUOTES.PMS.
##
##   So, the sequence of commands looks like this:
##
##      C:\PMAIL> rescom rquotes.r
##      C:\PMAIL> copy rquotes.rsc f:\mail\9000001\rquotes.pms
##
##   The general format of this file is a collection of text
##   resources; each text resource is a multiline group of
##   quoted strings, ending with \n wherever you want a line
##   break.
##
##   To activate your variable signature, place the characters
##   ~! in your signature file at the point where you want the
##   substitution to occur.
