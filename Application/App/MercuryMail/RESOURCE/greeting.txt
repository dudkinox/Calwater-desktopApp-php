Changing the SMTP greeting issued by MercuryS
---------------------------------------------

When an incoming connection is received by the MercuryS SMTP server,
the first thing MercuryS does is issue a "greeting". This greeting
typically looks like this:

--------- cut here --------------
220 somehost.somedomain.com Mercury/32 v3.21 ESMTP server ready.
--------- cut here --------------

The server then waits for the client to introduce itself and start
a mail transaction.

Recent suggested law changes in the U.S.A. and other countries may
make it desirable to be able to change the "greeting" issued by
MercuryS on connection, typically to indicate that certain types of
mail may not be welcome.

To change the MercuryS greeting, create a text file called
GREETING.MER in the directory where MERCURY.EXE is installed. This
file should contain the text you want MercuryS to display, and must
be no longer than 512 characters.

We recommend the following text as a starting point:

--------- cut here --------------
Use of this server for unauthorised relaying of mail is forbidden.
Unsolicited Commercial E-mail ("spam") is NOT WELCOME HERE.
--------- cut here --------------

If you were to use this text in your GREETING.MER file, then the
opening message displayed by MercuryS would look like this:

--------- cut here --------------
220-somehost.somedomain.com Mercury/32 v3.21 ESMTP server ready.
220-Use of this server for unauthorised relaying of mail is forbidden.
220 Unsolicited Commercial E-mail ("spam") is NOT WELCOME HERE.
--------- cut here --------------

MercuryS automatically adds the SMTP response codes and continuation
characters correctly.

Using an "extended greeting" in this way *may* on rare occasions
create problems with some older mail clients that cannot handle
multi-line greetings. We recommend that you experiment with the
feature for a while to make sure no mail interruption is occurring
before you fix it in place.

Remember, you cannot have more than 512 characters of data in your
GREETING.MER file.
