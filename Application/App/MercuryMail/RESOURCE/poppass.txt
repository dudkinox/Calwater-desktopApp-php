PopPass Extensions for Pegasus Mail
-----------------------------------

PopPass is a Pegasus Mail Extension (or plugin module) that allows
users of Pegasus Mail v3.0 and later systems to change their POP3
passwords using the MercuryW "change password" server, or a compatible
server.

To install the extension, follow these easy steps:

1: Locate the directory where you have installed Pegasus Mail

2: Look for a file called WINPMAIL.EXE - if you can find this file, 
   then copy POPPASS.DLL and POPPASS.FFF into the directory.

3: Look for a file called WINPM-32.EXE - if you can find this file,
   then copy PPASS32.DLL and PPASS32.FFF into the directory.

4: Restart your copy of Pegasus Mail.

To use the extension, choose "Change POP3 Password" from the
"Extensions" submenu of the "Tools" menu in Pegasus Mail.
