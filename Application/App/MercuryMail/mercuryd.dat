;
; MERCURYD.DAT is parsed by the MercuryD Distributing POP3 client to
; determine the sources from which it should obtain mail using the
; POP3 client protocol for distribution to local users.
;
; Each non-comment line in this file represents a single host/account
; combination MercuryD should contact to retrieve mail, using the
; following format:
;
;   host<,>username<,>password<,>local_user<,>default
;
;      "host"       - the domain name of the machine running the POP3
;                     server MercuryD should contact.
;      "username"   - the name MercuryD should use to login to the server
;      "password"   - the password matching "username" in plain text
;      "local_user" - The local user to whom mail downloaded from the
;                     specified account should be delivered.
;      "default"    - The user to whom mail should be delivered if no
;                     local recipients are found in a message.
;
;   Empty or blank parameters must be set to a single dash character, '-'.
;   Spaces are significant - only the ',' character is a valid delimiter.
;
;   If "local_user" is set to a single dash, MercuryD will attempt to
;   distribute the mail based on the "to:", "cc:" and "bcc:" fields in
;   each message. This is useful for sites running so-called "domain
;   mailboxes" - the first example entry below demonstrates this option.
;
;   "default" is only meaningful for domain mailbox entries, and is
;   intended to deal with problems like mailing list subscriptions,
;   where the local addressee often will not appear anywhere in the
;   message headers.
