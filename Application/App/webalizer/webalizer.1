.SH DESCRIPTION
The \fIWebalizer\fP is a web server log file analysis program which produces
usage statistics in HTML format for viewing with a browser.  The results
are presented in both columnar and graphical format, which facilitates
interpretation.  Yearly, monthly, daily and hourly usage statistics are
presented, along with the ability to display usage by site, URL, referrer,
user agent (browser), username, search strings, entry/exit pages,  and
country (some information may not be available if not present in the log
file being processed).
.PP
The \fIWebalizer\fP supports \fBCLF\fP (common log format) log files,
as well as \fBCombined\fP log formats as defined by NCSA and others,
and variations of these which it attempts to handle intelligently.  In
addition, the \fIWebalizer\fP supports \fBxferlog\fP formatted (\fIFTP\fP)
log files, \fBsquid\fP proxy logs and \fBW3C\fP extended format logs.
Logs may also be compressed, via \fIgzip\fP (.gz) or, if enabled at compile
time, \fIbzip2\fP (.bz2).  If a compressed log file is detected, it will be
automatically uncompressed while it is read.  Compressed logs must have the
standard \fIgzip\fP extension of \fB.gz\fP or \fIbzip2\fP extension of
\fB.bz2\fP.
.PP
\fIwebazolver\fP is normally just a symbolic link to the \fIWebalizer\fP.
When run as \fIwebazolver\fP, only DNS file creation/updates are performed,
and the program will exit once complete.  All normal options and
configuration directives are available, however many will not be used.
In addition, a DNS cache file must be specified.  If the number of DNS
children processes to use are not specified, the \fIwebazolver\fP will
default to \fB5\fP.

This documentation applies to The Webalizer Version 2.20
.SH RUNNING THE WEBALIZER
The \fIWebalizer\fP was designed to be run from a Unix command line prompt or
as a \fBcrond(8)\fP job. Once executed, the general flow of the program is:
.TP 8
.B o
A default configuration file is scanned for.  A file named
\fIwebalizer.conf\fP is searched for in the current directory, and if
found, it's configuration data is parsed.  If the file is not
present in the current directory,  the file \fI/etc/webalizer.conf\fP
is searched for and, if found, is used instead.
.TP 8
.B o
Any command line arguments given to the program are parsed.  This
may include the specification of a configuration file, which is
processed at the time it is encountered.
.TP 8
.B o
If a log file was specified, it is opened and made ready for
processing.  If no log file was given, \fISTDIN\fP is used for input.
If the log filename '\fB-\fP' is specified, \fISTDIN\fP will be forced.
.TP 8
.B o
If an output directory was specified, the program does a \fBchdir(2)\fP to
that directory in preparation for generating output.  If no output
directory was given, the current directory is used.
.TP 8
.B o
If a non-zero number of DNS Children processes were specified, they will
be started, and the specified log file will be processed, creating or
updating the specified DNS cache file.
.TP 8
.B o
If no hostname was given, the program attempts to get the hostname
using a \fBuname(2)\fP system call.  If that fails, \fIlocalhost\fP
is used.
.TP 8
.B o
A history file is searched for in the current directory (output
directory) and read if found.  This file keeps totals for previous
months, which is used in the main \fIindex.html\fP HTML document.
.B Note:
The file location can now be specified with the \fIHistoryName\fP
configuration option.
.TP 8
.B o
If incremental processing was specified, a data file is searched for
and loaded if found, containing the 'internal state' data of the
program at the end of a previous run.
.B Note:
The file location can now be specified with the \fIIncrementalName\fP
configuration option.
.TP 8
.B o
Main processing begins on the log file.  If the log spans multiple
months, a separate HTML document is created for each month.
.TP 8
.B o
After main processing, the main \fIindex.html\fP page is created, which
has totals by month and links to each months HTML document.
.TP 8
.B o
A new history file is saved to disk, which includes totals generated
by The \fIWebalizer\fP during the current run.
.TP 8
.B o
If incremental processing was specified, a data file is written that
contains the 'internal state' data at the end of this run.
.SH INCREMENTAL PROCESSING
The \fIWebalizer\fP supports incremental run capability.  Simply
put, this allows processing large log files by breaking them up into
smaller pieces, and processing these pieces instead.  What this means
in real terms is that you can now rotate your log files as often as you
want, and still be able to produce monthly usage statistics without the
loss of any detail.  Basically, The \fIWebalizer\fP saves and restores all
internal data in a file named \fIwebalizer.current\fP.  This allows the
program to 'start where it left off' so to speak, and allows the
preservation of detail from one run to the next.  The data file is
placed in the current output directory, and is a plain ASCII text
file that can be viewed with any standard text editor.  It's location
and name may be changed using the \fIIncrementalName\fP configuration
keyword.
.PP
Some special precautions need to be taken when using the incremental
run capability of The \fIWebalizer\fP.  Configuration options should not be
changed between runs, as that could cause corruption of the internal
data stored.  For example, changing the \fIMangleAgents\fP level will cause
different representations of user agents to be stored, producing invalid
results in the user agents section of the report.  If you need to change
configuration options, do it at the end of the month after normal
processing of the previous month and before processing the current month.
You may also want to delete the \fIwebalizer.current\fP file as well.
.PP
The \fIWebalizer\fP also attempts to prevent data duplication by keeping
track of the timestamp of the last record processed.  This timestamp
is then compared to current records being processed, and any records
that were logged previous to that timestamp are ignored.  This, in
theory, should allow you to re-process logs that have already been
processed, or process logs that contain a mix of processed/not yet
processed records, and not produce duplication of statistics.  The
only time this may break is if you have duplicate timestamps in two
separate log files... any records in the second log file that do have
the same timestamp as the last record in the previous log file processed,
will be discarded as if they had already been processed.  There are
lots of ways to prevent this however, for example, stopping the web
server before rotating logs will prevent this situation.  This setup
also necessitates that you always process logs in chronological order,
otherwise data loss will occur as a result of the timestamp compare.
.SH REVERSE DNS LOOKUPS
The \fIWebalizer\fP fully supports IPv4 and IPv6 DNS lookups, and
maintains a cache of those lookups to reduce processing the same
addresses in subsequent runs.  The cache file can be created at
run-time, or may be created before running the webalizer using either
the stand alone '\fIwebazolver\fP' program, or The Webalizer (DNS)
Cache file manager program '\fIwcmgr\fP'.  In order to perform reverse
lookups, a \fBDNSCache\fP file must be specified, either on the command
line or in a configuration file.  In order to create/update the cache
file at run-time, the number of \fBDNSChildren\fP must also be specified,
and can be anything between 1 and 100.  This specifies the number of
child processes to be forked, each of which will perform network DNS
queries in order to lookup up the addresses and update the cache.
Cached entries that are older than a specified TTL (time to live)
will be expired, and if encountered again in a log, will be looked
up at that time in order to 'freshen' them (verify the name is still
the same and update its timestamp).  The default TTL is 7 days, however
may be set to anything between 1 and 100 days.  Using the '\fIwcmgr\fP'
program, entries may also be marked as 'permanent', in which case
they will persist (with an infinite TTL) in the cache until manually
removed.  See the file \fBDNS.README\fP for additional information
and examples.
.SH GEOLOCATION LOOKUPS
The \fIWebalizer\fP has the ability to perform geolocation lookups on
IP addresses using either it's own internal \fIGeoDB\fP database,  or
optionally the \fIGeoIP\fP database from MaxMind, Inc. (www.maxmind.com).
If used, unresolved addresses will be searched for in the database and
its country of origin will be returned if found.  This actually produces
more accurate \fICountry\fP information than DNS lookups, since the DNS
address space has additional \fIgcTLDs\fP that do not necessarily map
to a specific country (such as \fI.net\fP and \fI.com\fP).  It is possible
to use both DNS lookups and geolocation lookups at the same time, which
will cause any addresses that could not be resolved using DNS lookups to
then be looked up in the database, greatly reducing the number of
\fIUnknown/Unresolved\fP entries in the generated reports.  The native
\fIGeoDB\fP geolocation database provided by The \fIWebalizer\fP fully
supports both \fIIPv4\fP and \fIIPv6\fP lookups, is updated regularly and
is the preferred geolocation method for use with The \fIWebalizer\fP.  The
most current version of the database can be obtained from our ftp site
(\fIftp://ftp.mrunix.net/\fP).
.SH COMMAND LINE OPTIONS
The \fIWebalizer\fP supports many different configuration options that will
alter the way the program behaves and generates output.  Most of these
can be specified on the command line, while some can only be specified
in a configuration file. The command line options are listed below,
with references to the corresponding configuration file keywords.
.PP

.TP 8
.B \-v
Be verbose.  Will cause the program to output informational
and \fIDebug\fP messages at run-time.
.TP 8
.B \-V
Display the program version and exit.  Additional program specific
information will be displayed if \fIverbose\fP mode is also used
(e.g. '\fI-vV\fP'), which can be useful when submitting bug reports.
.TP 8
.B \-d
\fBDebug\fP.  Display debugging information for errors and warnings.
.TP 8
.B \-i

.SH CONFIGURATION FILES
Configuration files are standard \fBASCII(7)\fP text files that may be created
or edited using any standard editor.  Blank lines and lines that begin
with a pound sign ('#') are ignored.  Any other lines are considered to
be configuration lines, and have the form "Keyword Value", where the
\'Keyword\' is one of the currently available configuration keywords defined
below, and 'Value' is the value to assign to that particular option.  Any
text found after the keyword up to the end of the line is considered the
keyword's value, so you should not include anything after the actual value
on the line that is not actually part of the value being assigned.  The
file \fIsample.conf\fP provided with the distribution contains lots of useful
documentation and examples as well.

.I General Configuration Keywords
.TP 8
.B LogFile \fIname\fP
Use log file named \fIname\fP.  If none specified, \fISTDIN\fP will be used.
.TP 8
.B LogType \fIname\fP

\'\fBwebalizer.hist\fP' in the standard output directory.
.TP 8
.B ReportTitle \fIname\fP
Use the title string \fIname\fP for the report title.  If none
specified, use the default of (in english) "\fIUsage Statistics for \fP".
.TP 8
.B HostName \fIname\fP
Set the hostname for the report as \fIname\fP.  If none specified, an
attempt will be made to gather the hostname via a \fBuname(2)\fP system
call.  If that fails, \fIlocalhost\fP will be used.
.TP 8

not prevent \fIIncremental\fP file processing.
.TP 8
.B IgnoreState \fP( yes | \fBno\fP )
Ignore incremental data file.  \fBUSE WITH CAUTION\fP.  By ignoring
the incremental data file, all previous processing for the current
month will be lost and those logs must be re-processed.
.TP 8
.B FoldSeqErr \fP( yes | \fBno\fP )
Fold out of sequence log records back into analysis by treating them
as if they had the same date/time as the last good record.  Normally,
out of sequence log records are ignored.

.TP 8
.B PageType \fIname\fP
Define the file extensions to consider as a \fIpage\fP.  If a file
is found to have the same extension as \fIname\fP, it will be counted
as a \fIpage\fP (sometimes called a \fIpageview\fP).
.TP 8
.B PagePrefix \fIname\fP
Allows URLs with the prefix \fIname\fP to be counted as a \fIpage\fP
type regardless of actual file type.  This allows you to treat contents
under specified directories as pages no matter what their extension is.  
.TP 8

Specifies URLs which should not be counted as pages, regardless of their
extension (or lack thereof).
.TP 8
.B GraphLegend \fP( \fByes\fP | no )
Allows the color coded graph legends to be enabled/disabled.

graphs produced.  Disable by using zero ('\fB0\fP'), default is \fB2\fP.
.TP 8
.B IndexMonths \fInum\fP
Specify the number of months to display in the main index (yearly summary)
table.  Default is 12 months.  Can be set to anything between 12 and 120
months (1 to 10 years).
.TP 8
.B YearHeaders \fP( \fByes\fP | no )
Enable/disable the display of year headers in the main index (yearly
summary) table.  If enabled, year headers will be shown when the table
is displaying more than 16 months worth of data.  Values can be 'yes'
or 'no'.  Default is 'yes'.
.TP 8
.B YearTotals \fP( \fByes\fP | no )
Enable/disable the display of year totals in the main index (yearly
summary) table.  If enabled, year totals will be shown when the table
is displaying more than 16 months worth of data.  Values can be 'yes'
or 'no'.  Default is 'yes'.
.TP 8
.B GraphMonths \fInum\fP
Specify the number of months to display in the main index (yearly
summary) graph.  Default is 12 months.  Can be set to anything between
12 and 72 months (1 to 6 years).
.TP 8
.B VisitTimeout \fInum\fP
Specifies the visit timeout value.  Default is \fI1800 seconds\fP (30
minutes).  A visit is determined by looking at the difference in time
between the current and last request from a specific site.  If the
difference is greater or equal to the timeout value, the request is
counted as a new visit.  Specified in seconds.
.TP 8
.B IndexAlias \fIname\fP
Use \fIname\fP as an additional alias for \fIindex.*\fP.
.TP 8
.B DefaultIndex \fP( \fByes\fP | no )
Enables or disables the use of '\fBindex.\fP' as a default index name
to be stripped from the end of URLs.  This does not effect any index
names that may be defined with the \fIIndexAlias\fP option.
.TP 8
.B MangleAgents \fInum\fP
Mangle user agent names based on mangle level \fInum\fP.  See the
\fI-M\fP command line switch for mangle levels and their meaning.
The default is \fB0\fP, which doesn't mangle user agents at all.
.TP 8
.B StripCGI \fP( \fByes\fP | no )
Determines if URL CGI variables should be stripped from the end of
URLs.  Values may be 'yes' or 'no', with the default being 'yes'.
.TP 8
.B TrimSquidURL \fInum\fP
Allows squid log URLs to be reduced in granularity by truncating
them after \fInum\fP slashes ('/') after the http:// prefix.  A
setting of one (1) will cause all URLs to be summarized by domain
only.  The default value is zero (0), which will disable any URL
modifications and leave them exactly as found in the log file.
.TP 8
.B SearchEngine\fP \fIname\fP \fIvariable\fP
Allows the specification of search engines and their query strings.
The \fIname\fP is the name to match against the referrer string for
a given search engine.  The \fIvariable\fP is the cgi variable that
the search engine uses for queries.  See the \fBsample.conf\fP file
for example usage with common search engines.
.TP 8
.B SearchCaseI\fP ( \fByes\fP | no )
Determines if search strings should be treated case insensitive or
not.  The default is 'yes', which lowercases all search strings
(treat as case insensitive).
.TP 8
.B Incremental \fP( yes | \fBno\fP )
Enable Incremental mode processing.
